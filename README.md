# Image-Reconstruction-Simulation-Software-Filtered-Back-Projection-Algorithm-

Run Execute.py to use the software interface for image processing operations! The source code related to this program is contained in the following files:

*getProjection: General image projection (Radon transform)
*ProjectionFilter: Image filtering (The filters used in this program are RL and SL filter functions)
*backProjection: Image back projection (inverse Radon transform)
*The Shepp-Logan model is encapsulated within the running program.
*Test images are provided in the testpics folder.

Note: This program may run relatively slowly when processing high-resolution images. It is recommended to use images with medium to low resolution for testing.
